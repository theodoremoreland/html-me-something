## Overview

This was the first webpage I ever created. It was created for a homework assignment at LaunchCode's _Lc101_ (2018). The assignment required the use of some basic HTML and CSS to create a webpage based on a theme of our choice. I chose to base my webpage on my feelings on Gears of War, a video game franchise I was very passionate about. Since 2018, I have made minor updates to the page's design and wording. _My feelings on the franchise, however - remain the same._

Screenshots of the webpage can be found below.
