               <p>My relationship with Gears of War is
                  complicated; my feelings about the game's potential are stronger than my feelings about the game's
                  reality.
                  Playing the game is like playing the lottery, on the rare occasion the game lives up to its potential,
                  it almost feels worthwhile.

            <h2>When Winning Isn't Enough</h2>
            <div class="p-wrapper">
               <p>A video game is a system of input and output, a dynamic appeal to a player's sense of amusement.
                  Competitive
                  video games are more than just virtual battlegrounds, they are entertainment frameworks. Entertainment
                  frameworks are not defined by wins and losses, they are defined by universal opportunity. Legitimate
                  issues are concerns of opportunity, and so persist outside the scope of one's performances. Win or
                  lose,
                  there's something fundamentally lacking in Gears of War's framework.</p>

            <h2>Attitude Alone Does Not Determine Altitude</h2>
            <div class="p-wrapper">
               <p>Like an irreparable matrimony, the game and I had reached our limits.
                  The kind, though promising, loses something invaluable along the way.
                  Where no amount of mental framing could rekindle the passion, no amount of dedication could rectify
                  the
                  relationship. I just had to move on.

            <h2><i>People don't know what they want until you show it to them</i></h2>

               <p>
                  There is a saying - "A good Dentist doesn't pull a tooth because of a toothache". The most important
                  lesson I've
                  learned from playing Gears of War is that genuine feedback and a genuine effort to respond
                  to feedback do not always facilitate an evolution.
                  Fans and focus groups are great at addressing
                  what they like and don't like when it concerns isolated facts, but not so great at communicating why
                  said
                  facts matter in the context
                  of a particular game dynamic nor in the context of their core values. It is insight into the player's
                  core values, an
                  understanding of the dynamics at large, and intuition that empowers designers to
                  wield
                  feedback effectively.
                  In simply meeting the demands of a fanbase, you are always one step behind in seeing the game's
                  potential.
