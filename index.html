<h2>Since '06:</h2>
<p>I've been playing Gears of War, on and off, for about 12 years. It's not something I'm proud of. I don't even like to reflect on my experiences. Instead of all the fun I've had and all the people I've met, what rather comes to mind is how misunderstood my relationship has been; how I once loved the game, then the game and I grew apart. How despite my overwhelming disapproval, certain potentialities were too intense to ignore.</p>

<h2>Attitude Alone Does Not Determine Altitude:</h2>
<p>I've tried to reframe my mind time and time again. No matter the attitude, there was something fundamentally wrong. I wasn't having fun. I started to feel like I was trying to make love with a partner I grew to despise. Although the potential was there, although we had proven to be succesful in the past, something important had changed. No amount of mental framing was going to rekindle that attraction, no amount of dedication was going to justify the act.</p>

<h2>When Winning Isn't Enough:</h2>
<p>A video game is a system of input and output, a dynamic appeal to a player's sense of amusemet. Competitive video games are more than just battlegrounds, they are entertainment frameworks. Entertainment is sustained, fostered, cultivated, not earned. No victory nor defeat distinguishes entertainment, entertainment is the effect of mechanics and conditions, aesthetics and values, thrills and adventure.</p>

<h2>A Complaint is Not Equivalent to "The Problem":</h2>
<p>When discussing the shortcomings of a project like Gears of War, deducing problems comes naturally to no one. The matter is so complicated and subjective that problems are counter-intuitive, they manifest as innervations, conflicting with amusement. "The problem" would be the theory; how and why the innervations? What could be less disturbing about the framework? The solution is never explicitly stated because providing a solution entails an entire theoretical framework, not just a criticism or complaint, such theory is the designer's vision.</p>
