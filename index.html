<h2>Since '06:</h2>
<p>My relationship with Gears of War is far from ideal. Despite our 12 year history, I'm reluctant to consider myself a fan. If I had a position on Gears of War, it would be more accurately the one of critic. Though, this definition doesn't encapsulate my relationship either. My relationship with Gears of War is complicated; it's a game that I want to love, but I'm very particular in my standards.</p>

<h2>Attitude Alone Does Not Determine Altitude:</h2>
<p> I don't like Gears of War per se, but it does possess a certain allure. Much like a tease, there's groundwork for arousal, but in the end, little is ever satisfied. I've tried to get the most out of the game, adopting strategies and attitudes, but there are limits. Like an irreparable matrimony, the game and I had reached those limits. The kind, though promising, loses something invaluable along the way. Where no amount of mental framing could rekindle the passion, no amount of dedication could rectify the relationship. I've exhausted my resources, the game just has to change.</p>

<h2>When Winning Isn't Enough:</h2>
<p>A video game is a system of input and output, a dynamic appeal to a player's sense of amusemet. Competitive video games are more than just virtual battlegrounds, they are entertainment frameworks. Entertainment frameworks are not defined by individual success, they are defined by universal opportunity. Legitimate issues are concerns of opportunity, and so persist outside the scope of my performaces. Win or lose, there's something fundamentally lacking within Gears of War's framework.</p>

<h2>Detailed Complaints Are Not Definitive Problems (Placeholder):</h2>
<p>Draft:: Identifying problems within an entertainment framework often grows incredibly abstract. What begins as an unpleasant innvervation, becomes an exercise in theory. Why do such innervations persist? What do I fundamentally need? Consistency? Balance? Depth or Novelty? Does it get more specific than simply being amused? What makes something amusing and at what point do dynamics conflict with being amused? Where does amusement overlap? How is it cultivated? These questions are just the tip of the iceberg. Within a wealth of experience and consideration there are answers, but it's all so incredibly complex.</p>
