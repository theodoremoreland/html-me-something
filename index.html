         <h1>A Love Hate Relationship</h1>

         <h2>Since '06:</h2>
         <p>My relationship with Gears of War is
            complicated; my feelings about the game's potential are stronger than my feelings about the game's reality.
            Playing the game is like playing the lottery, on the rare occasion the game lives up to its potential,
            it almost feels worthwhile, "almost" being the operative term.

         <h2>When Winning Isn't Enough:</h2>
         <p>A video game is a system of input and output, a dynamic appeal to a player's sense of amusement. Competitive
            video games are more than just virtual battlegrounds, they are entertainment frameworks. Entertainment
            frameworks are not defined by wins and losses, they are defined by universal opportunity. Legitimate
            issues are concerns of opportunity, and so persist outside the scope of one's performances. Win or lose,
            there's something fundamentally lacking in Gears of War's framework.</p>

         <h2>Attitude Alone Does Not Determine Altitude:</h2>
         <p>Like an irreparable matrimony, the game and I had reached our limits.
            The kind, though promising, loses something invaluable along the way.
            Where no amount of mental framing could rekindle the passion, no amount of dedication could rectify the
            relationship. I just had to move on.

         <h2>"People donâ€™t know what they want until you show it to them"</h2>
         <p>I once heard someone say "A good Dentist doesn't pull a tooth because of a toothache".
            I would also add: a good Dentist might pull a tooth even if there is no
            toothache. The most important lesson I've
            learned from playing Gears of War is that genuine feedback and a genuine effort to respond
            to feedback doesn't always facilitate an evolution. Fans and focus groups are great at addressing
            what they like and don't like, but not so great at communicating
            how certain features relate to the bigger picture. Vision of the bigger picture equips designers
            with enough empathy, insight, and intuition to wield feedback effectively.
