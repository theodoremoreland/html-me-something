<h3>The Nature of Introverted Thinking</h3>

<p>The investigation of thought insist upon a certain orientation, for to find a thought, one must look within - that, is the essence of introverted thinking. Our observations have a certain scope, in which only sensory information can be accrued; introverted thinking approaches reality in efforts to go beyond that scope. Introverted thinking, therefore, is a approach whereby it's user scrutinizes an idea by the standard of which it's user has experienced thought. 


<h2>Introverted Thinking on the MBTI</h2>

- questionairre's are communication instruments, not quantification instruments
-forer effect is an effect, but what is the cause?
- pseudoscience has many meanings, lets address some:
- the influence of self reporting
- type is a concept in which similar entities are identified as having distinct qualities. If the entitiy in question is psycholgy (or, the mind), whether or not one's mind is or isn't of a particular type is a question of whther or not the supposed distinction being made can be identified. The MBTI's biggest problem isn't the questionairre's, nor the pseudosciences, nor the forer effect, but a lack equivocal nature of the subject. If in practicing concepts, distincts are too subtle to confirm, the type's by extension can not be validated. 


<h2>Introverted Thinking on Vultology</h2>
- the problem with vultology is that despite the validaty of facial expressions being present in certain types, the distinction being made intially to confirm their type has not be made clear.

Cogito ergo sum, "I think and therefore I am" is a reknown proposition for it's philosophical implications; the very questioning of one's existence is evidence for one's own existence, for one cannot question existence without existing. Cogito ergo sum, perhaps more importantly, also has a psychological implcation; being that one is capable of addressing one's own thoughts.
